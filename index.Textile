{% include JB/setup %}

TBone removes the complexity of manually managing data dependencies in Backbone, enabling "live" templates as well functions that automatically re-execute when the data they reference changes.

TBone is designed to scale with your application, enabling simple re-use of data throughout your application without you needing to tell the page what to update when that data changes.

At AppNeta, we've used TBone to eliminate a set of custom page events corresponding such as "refresh data" and "add filter"; with a large application, it becomes difficult to manage what exactly needs to be refreshed when something changes.  While Backbone is a critical step toward reducing this complexity, TBone enables us to do so without even thinking about event binding; every view and model stays in sync by design and without unnecessary work.

{% highlight html %}
<div tbone="inline onMyDesk">
    My <stapler><%=stapler.color%> <%=stapler.brand%> stapler</stapler>.
</div>
It is <input type="text" tbone="view input" data-value="stapler.color" />
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
tbone.createView('onMyDesk', function() {
    this.$('stapler').css('background', tbone('stapler.color'));
});
{% endhighlight %}

<section class="example">
  <div tbone="inline onMyDesk">
      My <stapler><%=stapler.color%> <%=stapler.brand%> stapler</stapler>.
  </div>
  It is <input type="text" tbone="view input" data-value="stapler.color" />
</section>
